      "I have two MacBook Airs (MBA), a 13\" and a 11, both with the previous form factor (the wide, body colored bezel around the screen, 1280x800 resolution) and this new 13\" MBA improves upon it in every way (almost) and makes it nearly perfect. Good: - SCREEN looks great!  2560x1600 resolution is bright and sharp and looks good with the thin black bezel.  I usually don't go above 50% brightness. - KEYBOARD is good.  Some have mentioned that it still sucks, but I find it much better than the older MBAs that I own and better than say, the Magic Keyboard.  Even with a thin silicone keyboard cover I find the typing experience to be much better and I can type faster and with fewer mistakes. - BATTERY LIFE is fantastic.  Haven't done any real testing yet and obviously it depends on a lot of factors (wifi usage, video streaming, HD vs 4k video viewing/processing/etc., screen brightness, type of app being used, etc.) but for my usage (mostly web browsing, video viewing on YouTube, accessing VPN for work (Citrix, EPIC), etc., it has been great.  Easily tops 10 hours and super impressed so far. - LOOKS GREAT.  Love the newer (I know that the actual exterior design is a few years old by now) design, looks and feels great.  Form factor is nice and it is a reasonable weight. - NO FAN.  That's awesome, as it not only stays quiet all the time but you also do not need to worry about blocking any fan vents on the bottom or back of the case while you have it on your lap.  Pretty amazing really for a laptop to have no fans. - PERFORMANCE.  It works great so far on what I have used it for, which is not terribly a lot, but it is what it is for a laptop using Apple silicon for the first time.  For just day to day use and things like Chrome, Office (Word, Excel), Citirx, EPIC, etc., it has been super smooth and fast.  Have not tried gaming yet but do not have high hopes given it is the base model with 7-core GPU.  Also, things like start up are noticeably faster with the M1 versus my 2020 iMac 27\" (top end) with Intel chips. - TOUCH ID is great still.  Works very fast and the button does not get greasy (which makes it not work well) like the old iPhone home buttons.  On the other hand, it should really have Face ID at this point. - APPLE ECOSYSTEM is great as usual and a real reason to get this MBA.  Apple Watch easily unlocks it (so you do not really need Face ID if you have the watch).  You can easily send/receive files using AirDrop or cast using AirPlay.  And so on and so forth. - BIG SUR comes preinstalled but you need to update to get 11.0.1. NOT GOOD: - WEBCAM still sucks.  Still low resolution and just does not look good in FaceTime, Teams, etc.  Shame that Apple is so slow to upgrade webcams on the Macs (the 27\" iMac FINALLY upgraded to 1080p front cams only a couple months ago... I got one and it looks so much better than this MBA's camera). - ONLY 2 PORTS.  Sad that this thing has only 2 USB-C ports (that cover thunderbolt 3, USB 3.1, charging, DisplayPort).  Given that it is used to charge, it leaves only one USB-C port for other use, pretty lame.  I wish they had squeezed (I think it would fit) a USB-A port so that I could plug in my wireless mouse USB-A dongle as I have never liked any bluetooth mouse, or at least one more USB-C port. - NEW TECH (Apple silicon) means the M1-optimized apps are still being rolled out, e.g. Photoshop still not available at release. - BATTERY still cannot be removed, no surprise here, but means that like all Apple mobile tech it will have a useable lifespan determined at least partly by the non-removable battery.  Easier to have an iPhone's battery replaced than a MBA I would imagine but hopefully it maintains a high level of performance for 4 years at the minimum. OVERALL: A few negatives (mostly the webcam) but enough significant improvements that this MBA is really a no-brainer for anyone needing a non-power notebook compute, especially if s/he is already in the Apple ecosystem.  Love it so far!",

      "Apple USED to make great computers... Past tense! I've used them for many (almost 20) years but recently bought this computer in December and my sentiments about this brand has completely changed. How the mighty have fallen! I was always the biggest Apple supporter. I have purchased many as gifts for relatives as well as bought them for myself. From the Apple watches to the screens and desktops to the macbook pros, macbook airs and phones. I defended them against the Apple haters and always had their backs. I thought I was going to be Apple for life. I even own many shares of their stock, which I will be dumping soon because I see the writing on the wall. I could tell something was up with them as Apple continues to have great earnings reports but their stock doesn't move. It's the biggest slug of a stock. I now think I have stumbled upon the reason why. If you google the recent complaints about Apple you will see. Apple does not have the great customer service they once had. I was mistaken to think they did. They have also started cheaping out... big time. The result? Products that don't last. Couple that with customer service that could give a flying eff if you remain a customer of theirs and I'm sensing a recipe for disaster unfolding here... Selling all of my $AAPL stock ASAP stat. Warning, do not buy this computer! Apple's quality has gone wayyy downhill. The MacBook Air cords are absolutely horrendous! I am on my third Apple cord in less than 6 months. I brought the product to an Apple store and the employee denied that there was any problem with their cords and instead blamed me. He told me I must be doing something wrong. Nothing has changed about my usage of their products. I've always used them the same way and never had issues with my cords until the computer was really old. Think years and years. Not months. So you'd think if I was the problem like this guy tried to say I was, I'd be going through computer cords right and left, right? Well I haven't. And looking up my account would prove that. However, Apple doesn't care. They want to charge me for to replace their defective products anyway. Welcome to the new Apple where the customer is always WRONG. Then the guy doubled down and told me that he'd been working at the Apple store for 10 years and I'm the ONLY person who has ever had a problem with their cord. A simple google search has proved that to be completely false. Everybody complains about the quality of their cords. This must be huge business for them selling cords like this. So the employees gaslight you and will blame you if something goes wrong. If you want to sign on for that, good luck. I hope you never run into a problem and see what I'm talking about but you'll be fooling yourself because it will only a matter of time. I am DONE! I work too hard for my money and they aren't the only computer show on the road. Lucky for me I speak PC too. Thanks for nothing Apple! Good job burning that bridge. You just lost a loyal customer over $19. Hope it was worth the extra $$$$. It's not the money Apple. It's the principle. I won't do business with companies who treat me like that, period. Peace out!",

      "Pros:  USB-C, Finally! As a past Surface Pro user, this was never a feature. With a USB-C, like any computer, you can do so much more with this device now. From headphones to connecting external 4k monitors, to charging this and other devices (USB-C chargers are 10x cheaper to get), to even connecting an Ethernet adaptor. About time Microsoft.  Its a very sold machine. I go no flex issues, the frame feels sturdy, and overall I felt that I can throw this in a bag and not worry.  Its light. Not IPad light, but enough that you wont feel worried that youre not going to bend it.  The microphone set up on the Pro is a big upgrade. Skype calls from my parents came crisp and clear in an indoor, TV on, volume. The web video is what it is, but the microphone setup is a thumbs up.  Cortana listens to you pretty well. Im learning Spanish so translating even simple questions, from English to Spanish, Cortana does a lot better than either using Alexa or Google Assistant. Also questions about directions, weather, and others were spot on.  Excellent display. The screen is bright, outstanding saturation/color balance, and also offers ambient light sensing when it gets dark. When you go to settings you can modify it for a specific time, or it will automatically adjust when the sun goes down in your location.  Microsoft mastered the kickstand on this. Numerous ranges of all angels, and is even quite steady when its placed on my lap.  microSD reader (for upgraded memory option)  Headphone Jack. I find this feature a must if youre planning to edit videos on this.  Solid State Drive (SDD) on a tablet size is one of the best things. If you have to choose, always an SSD, regardless of memory size. Faster, cooler, and  Charging on this is very fast. From 0 to 50% it took around 45-50 minutes. Note that I was using the charging cords that it came with. Dont expect the same results when using an off-brand.  A lot of horsepower for a tablet. Inside is an Ice Lake processor. To summarize, it features smaller transistors that makes multi-tasking an non-issue. Trying out for the first time with around 10 apps running (Madden, Netflix, Live Maps, Grand Trims Mo, etc.), the machine had no lag or hiccups. Largely the effects of this chip will be appreciated in the next 2 years from when you get this tablet.  The processor allows Wi-Fi 6 to be enforced on this tablet. This area is still new but within the next year, this tablet will already be up to date with the hardware. Meaning stronger upload and download rates.  The speakers shoot sound directly to my face. Turning on Spotify, I got a decent quality in sound. With rock and country, I got a very balanced, and a lot of power in the volume. For the average listener its quite good. Not IPad level but still good to make the list.  I can see the 3:2 screen a benefit for those who want to read, show notes, and display documents at work. Not many tablets can provide this without losing some quality. For me, I saw no waste in this Surface. Cons and Oks:  The chunky bezel. Stick to the times Microsoft, this cant be ignored in 2019. Its very thick and with competitors providing bezel-less frames, or close to it, this is a major turn off (Not to mention that Microsoft itself has a Surface Pro X with a design that is significantly less in the bezel. (Why not this one?).  With the bezel issue, the screen size makes the tablet look 2 years older than what it is.  Last year's model and this one are 99% the same in design. Remove the USB-C connector and itll be 100% the same. A very outdated design as I think Microsoft invested all their money on the internals and just forgot about the redesigning.  The battery life isnt great. Im getting around 8 hours of power. Thats having Wi-Fi always on, web surfing, daily YouTube playing, and a couple of hours with Netflix (plus a couple of smaller apps). It can last a whole day if you control your power and your screen display, but its nowhere near what Microsoft is saying.  Dont take it outside on a sunny day. That sun glare is too powerful for this display brightness.  Keyboard and Surface Pen are sold separately. I didnt test these as you only get the tablet.  Even though USB-C is a great thing to have, were already in the USB 3.1 world. With also no Thunderbolt 3 (quick file transfer) I wish that Microsoft put more effort into the outside design as much as they put in there hardware on this machine.  I found no issue playing Overwatch on this but trying to play Call of Duty forget it. This isnt for deep gaming and playing Overwatch killed a decent chunk of the battery. Bottom Line: If youre going to buy this, you need to at least invest in there keyboard cover. Its disappointing that to fully experience your Pro, you need to put down money on its keyboard and pen. Without a keyboard, from my experience, youre pretty limited. I used a Logitech Bluetooth keyboard and mouse, but the portably is limited if you cant attach them to the Surface Pro. Also we're in the age of laptops, tablets, and phones trying to reach the goal to be bezel-less. I have the previous model on hand and I cant tell them apart in any way. Thanks to these 2019 new laptops/tablets, the bezels on this device make it feel like this tablet is from 2017. Im also irritated that Microsoft didnt at least try to improve the design. But if you can deal with the design (and the battery) issues, youll know that Microsoft put all their money on whats inside the system. From the new core processors, this tablet is a beast. I found it very fast, reliable, and it will stand its ground for 2+ years. For me thats the beauty of a Surface Pro: a PC in the size of a tablet. Im always a PC fan and this performs as if I had a laptop on my lap, something an IPad cant do. If you can deal with the generic bezel look, and put money down for their keyboard, youre getting a beast of a computer fitting in a tablet. Overall: An outdated design that packs a lot of power for those who want more than just a generic tablet on the go. Hope I was a help to you. Love, Honest Reviewer",

      "Have had issues with it since purchasing. Front facing camera would work to take pictures. Would not with any apps. Contacted seller they say call Microsoft. After many hours and a full reboot it was fixed. WiFi constantly disconnects and cant find a network. Periodically boots up very slowly.",
    worst_review:
      "This computer has an extremely sensitive auto-rotate function which cannot be adjusted/toggled in Settings. As a result, this computer will make you scream out loud in frustration. You will be sitting down, and all of a sudden the auto-rotate will be activated, and the keyboard is useless and you can only use the device as a touch screen. God forbid you move the computer--it really doesn't like that. Sometimes I need to restart the computer entirely; other times restarting doesn't even help. I am a student and I need to be able to type. However, it seems that this is too high a request. Each session, I spend an inordinate amount of time trying to get the computer out of \"auto-rotate hell\", during which I waste time and I can't get anything done. Do yourself a favor and stay away from this device, and for that matter, probably this entire line in general. It's a total gimmick, its extremely glitchy and sloppy, and you will waste time both troubleshooting and when you inevitably attempt to get a refund.",
